## Questions
1. What main-category of project has the highest success rate?
2. For the main-category of project with highest success rate (question above), 
   what is the category with the highest number of project proposals?
3. What is the median pledged amount (usd_pledged_real) of successfully funded projects?
4. What is the number of successfully funded projects with more than 5.000$ pledged 
   (usd_pledged_real) per category?
   (OPTIONAL: In case you decide to visualize all successful projects per category and you perceive any clusters in the   
   results, try to use the MeanShift algorithm on to see if your gut feeling was correct)
5. For the main-category with the most successfully funded projects (quantity, not rate of success), what is the goal-         
   amount range (usd_goal_real), e.g. range 0-10k$ , 5-15k$, 100k$-110k$, that contains the most successfully funded   
   projects (in quantity, not rate of success)?
